1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All units, this is my arrest! Hold off!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Negative, Unit 5C. Need for backup. Do not engage.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's not getting away.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're gonna be okay, kid. Just hold on.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Officer Balch, 16 years.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I said you're looking at 16 years, if you're lucky.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But it's your lucky day. You've been given another option.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're willing to expunge your record, erase your sentence.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In exchange, you go to one of our off-site prisons and participate in a little social experiment.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Anything! I'll do it! Just take me!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What the hell?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fresh meat!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ow!

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's for my husband! Burn in hell, asshole!

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Cops like you don't survive these games, ever. But you're my ticket out of here.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Congratulations, Leonard Balch. You've made it to Phase 2.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's time to meet the other Cell Blocks.
