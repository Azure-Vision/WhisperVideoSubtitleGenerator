00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
All units, this is my arrest! Hold off!

00:04.000 --> 00:05.333
Negative, Unit 5C.

00:05.333 --> 00:06.667
Need for backup.

00:06.667 --> 00:08.000
Do not engage.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
He's not getting away.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
You're gonna be okay, kid. Just hold on.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Officer Balch, 16 years.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
What?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.600
I said you're looking at 16 years, if you're

00:26.600 --> 00:27.000
lucky.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
But it's your lucky day.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You've been given another option.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.333
We're willing to expunge your record, erase

00:34.333 --> 00:35.000
your sentence.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.706
In exchange, you go to one of our off-site

00:38.706 --> 00:41.588
prisons and participate in a little social

00:41.588 --> 00:42.000
experiment.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Anything! I'll do it! Just take me!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
What the hell?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Fresh meat!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Ow!

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
That's for my husband! Burn in hell, asshole!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.333
Cops like you don't survive these games,

01:05.333 --> 01:06.133
ever.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.000
But you're my ticket out of here.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.333
Congratulations, Leonard Balch.

01:16.333 --> 01:19.000
You've made it to Phase 2.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
It's time to meet the other Cell Blocks.
