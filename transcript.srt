1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All units, this is my arrest! Hold off!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,333
Negative, Unit 5C.

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,667
Need for backup.

4
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,000
Do not engage.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's not getting away.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're gonna be okay, kid. Just hold on.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Officer Balch, 16 years.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,600
I said you're looking at 16 years, if you're

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,000
lucky.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But it's your lucky day.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You've been given another option.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,333
We're willing to expunge your record, erase

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,000
your sentence.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,706
In exchange, you go to one of our off-site

16
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,588
prisons and participate in a little social

17
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:42,000
experiment.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Anything! I'll do it! Just take me!

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What the hell?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fresh meat!

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ow!

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's for my husband! Burn in hell, asshole!

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,333
Cops like you don't survive these games,

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,133
ever.

25
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,000
But you're my ticket out of here.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,333
Congratulations, Leonard Balch.

27
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,000
You've made it to Phase 2.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's time to meet the other Cell Blocks.
